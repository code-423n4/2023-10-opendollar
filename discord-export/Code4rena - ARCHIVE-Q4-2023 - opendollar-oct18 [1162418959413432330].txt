‘Forge build’ taking hours to compile🤦🏽‍♂️

[10/19/2023 19:01] nican0r
@pi0neerpat | Open Dollar @cupOjoseph  I'm a bit unclear on what the system coins do, are they what's used inside the system once a user has deposited LSTs so they can all be handled equivalently? Are they what's used to collateralize debt positions in a vault?


[10/19/2023 19:02] xariextz
Can we assume that everything that is out of the pull request is already audited and working? Things like CommonActions etc.


[10/19/2023 19:19] pi0neerpat
The audit is not public yet. It was performed by another team. The changes from that audit have not been added yet.


[10/19/2023 19:21] pi0neerpat
The system coin is what’s used to keep track of all value within the protocol. It’s also the ERC20 that’s given to wallets when debt is minted

Are we using one Vault721 for all of the users and NFTs or does each user have their own vault?

Each user creates their own vaults. Ownership is tied to the NFT ownership. Therefore a user may also receive a vault via transfer of the NFT

[10/20/2023 19:20] yashar0x
I'm talking to the sponsor team and trying to solve this 
Seems there is a workaround for this but it's a little bit complicated


[10/20/2023 19:30] yashar0x (pinned)
Guys this is the workaround

1- Delete every .json files within broadcast/Deploy.s.ol/31337 and also within deployments folder
2- Open a terminal and type: anvil
3- Copy one of the Private Keys from anvil output and paste it in .env: ANVIL_ONE={Your Private Key}
4- yarn deploy:anvil (This command will create some .json files in this path: broadcast/Deploy.s.ol/31337
5- Copy all the .json files from broadcast/Deploy.s.ol/31337 and paste them in deployments
6- command: node tasks/parseAnvilDeployments.js
5- run your forge command (E.g: forge t --fork-url $ANVIL_RPC --match-contract NFTAnvil --match-test test_setup -vvvvvv)

You have to do this everytime you run anvil

Hey y'all dont forget its office hours. all the devs are hanging out and answering your questions


[10/21/2023 02:41] mrosas
What's the deployment contracts begin with?


[10/21/2023 02:41] mrosas
What is deployed first?


[10/21/2023 03:10] cupojoseph (pinned)
roughly the order: https://github.com/open-dollar/od-contracts/blob/dev/script/GoerliContracts.s.sol
this is the output of our last goerli deployment roughly in order that things are deployed. deployment is totally automated, so you can verify the order of things in the deployment scripts there


[10/21/2023 03:11] cupojoseph
I think technically the deployment scripts were not included in the audit scope, but if you find something there related to in scope contracts that would be very interesting to us!

[10/21/2023 11:26] 0xprinc
certainly this is what they have provided 
```
Grants permission to the ODSafeManager to make modifications to a safe. A new SAFEHandler is deployed for each safe, whose address serves as a unique identifier within the SAFEEngine
```


[10/21/2023 12:27] cupojoseph
Yes, everyone should have 1 proxy.

some of y'all had qs about running Anvil, so here are the steps:
```
1. set `URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545`
2. run `anvil`
3. use Anvil private keys provided
4. run `yarn deploy:anvil`
5. in broadcast/Deploy.s.sol/31337, move `run-latest.json` into deployments/anvil folder to overwrite the existing file
6. run `node tasks/parseAnvilDeployments.js`
7. run a test script, for example:
`forge t --fork-url $URL --match-contract NFTAnvil -vvvvv`
```

Why is this included in `_isNotProxy()` function.
I think this condition will never occur as OWNER is set at the starting and is immutable so this condition is never be true.

[10/23/2023 02:40] 0xauditism
Thank you for being available over the week end !


[10/23/2023 03:52] cupojoseph
if you mean this `_rate`: https://github.com/open-dollar/od-contracts/blob/67e5917e7dc0c16324aff3fde0298cd218a15152/src/contracts/proxies/actions/BasicActions.sol#L37

its getting that from `_safeEngine` so we can check out the current deployment of the safe engine here: https://goerli.arbiscan.io/address/0x32474e5Cf3452DFCc6ca340600cAC1f78C9aF733#code
and query it directly to test the result and see how many digits it has

or the natspec comments can be helpful in the getter functions and structs to know the units:
(from `ISAFEEngine.sol`): https://github.com/open-dollar/od-contracts/blob/67e5917e7dc0c16324aff3fde0298cd218a15152/src/interfaces/ISAFEEngine.sol#L173

```javascript
  struct SAFEEngineCollateralData {
    // Total amount of debt issued by the collateral type
    uint256 /* WAD */ debtAmount;
    // Total amount of collateral locked in SAFEs using the collateral type
    uint256 /* WAD */ lockedAmount;
    // Accumulated rate of the collateral type
    uint256 /* RAY */ accumulatedRate;
    // Floor price at which a SAFE is allowed to generate debt
    uint256 /* RAY */ safetyPrice;
    // Price at which a SAFE gets liquidated
    uint256 /* RAY */ liquidationPrice;
  }
```
So accumulated rate is expected n RAY units

- `AccountingEngine` functions are called by `BasicActions`
- `BasicActions` restricts calling to be delegateCall
- `ODProxy` DelegateCall to `BasicActions` , then it calls the functions in the `AccountingEngine` in the context of `ODProxy` 

Is this context correct? @pi0neerpat | Open Dollar

Because of the PID controller and the repricing of debt the accounting engine is needed to keep track of the surplus and settle the debt with the taxes to calculate the surplus. Our primary change to the accounting engine is changing how the surplus fees flow to sending some of them to the surplus auction house and sending some to an external address which is the DOA Treasury

Hello, from a user point of view, how is the function `allowSAFE()` in `ODSafeManager.sol` supposed to be executed ? What is the workflow ?


[10/24/2023 08:38] al_qa_qa
- It Checks that the caller (msg.sender), is allowed to modify this safe.
- Then it gives the access to the `_user` address sent as a parameter, to control the safe too.


[10/24/2023 08:39] rahiti
I meant, should you go through the proxy to call the `allowSAFE()` function or call it directly ?


[10/24/2023 08:45] al_qa_qa
- Proxy delegatecalls the functions, so if you call a function from another contract it will affect Proxy context, not the contract itself.
- `ODProxy` delegatecall to Action contracts like `BasicAction.sol` , this contracts don't change the context, you will find that these contracts fires another contract `ODSafeManager` as example functions.
- The point for delegatecall is to preserve msg.sender only, not else.
- You can't fire the function directly without proxies (since proxies are the owners), and proxy can only delegatecall, so in order to change you need to execute functions that make external calls to the `ODSafeManger` contract like `BasicAction`


[10/24/2023 09:28] stormreckson
From what I understand the owner of the safe can call this the `allowSAFE` ..prior to the call the owner whould have called `build` to get a proxy then `allowSAFE` can be called on the `_usr` (the user must also be a proxy account) if a user is added to the safeCan mapping then they can also call the function ... So I think it's actually through the proxy.... I might be wrong, I'm open to corrections.

here safe means safe AA wallet ?


[10/24/2023 11:07] al_qa_qa
SAFE is the collateral-dept position.

As I understood, SAFE is the collateral paid by users to mint new tokens, like MakerDAO. But instead of giving the users the ownership, Open Dollar team makes these SAFEs owned by Vault721 NFT. And this NFTs are owner by the the proxies, that is being deployed when minting to the owner address. I know its kind of a long way, but this is the codebase.

When the user open new SAFE, it means there are new tokens to mint. the SAFE contain the tokens in collateral and the minted tokens (dollars). and since the price changes, the SAFE collateral may be less that the dollars value, or vice versa.

You don't need to understand how this process warks, since its out of the audit scope, and this code isbeing audited from OpenZeppelin, so its secure.

[10/24/2023 15:04] daopunk
oh yeah, i see now. that part should be deleted


[10/24/2023 15:08] rahiti
I'd like to give allowance to another user (user B) so he can access a safe. I understood that in order to do that, user A has to go throught his proxy to execute a function on the `BasicActions.sol` contract. That is what I've done to `openSAFE()` for user A.
But now, I can't find the right function in `BasicActions.sol` that would allow me to execute `allowSAFE()` on the `ODSafeManager`.
Can you tell me more about it please ?


[10/24/2023 15:23] cupojoseph
You don't need a basic action to call allowSafe, you should be able to call it directly with a proxy using execute


[10/24/2023 15:36] al_qa_qa
Are you sure for this answer 🤔?

Delegatecall don't change the context of the target contract. so if it is called as you said, nothing will changes. in `ODSafeManager`.


[10/24/2023 16:23] nmirchev8
Are you spoiling something?


[10/24/2023 16:26] al_qa_qa
Nope


[10/24/2023 16:30] klau5_
sent DM! @cupOjoseph


[10/24/2023 16:38] 0xarno
you should not disclose issues publicly


[10/24/2023 16:39] 0xhuy0512
It's not deploy yet so it's OK


[10/24/2023 16:55] 0xarshia
@cupOjoseph can you please check Dm Thanks


[10/24/2023 16:56] al_qa_qa
I thought @cupOjoseph said this by mistake, as this problem will get clear in unit test. So I thought he replied by a wrong answer not else.


[10/24/2023 16:59] 0xarav
Its ok, I'm sure anyone who spent some time on the code
would already know this by now


[10/24/2023 17:51] m4k2
@cupOjoseph I've DM you


[10/24/2023 18:37] m4k2
or if any other devs is available ?


[10/24/2023 20:45] pi0neerpat
Only 1 more day left. Love to see the amount of smart people here looking at our code!

[10/24/2023 22:32] pi0neerpat
interesting, does this change the return from getSafesData


[10/24/2023 22:33] pi0neerpat
I'm not sure if we are even using that function anywhere


[10/24/2023 22:37] nethoxa
Is that a question?


[10/24/2023 22:37] nethoxa
I wrote it just because I found it funny


[10/24/2023 22:37] nethoxa
Wdym?


[10/24/2023 23:20] pi0neerpat
Is it not supposed to be i++ ? whats funny?


[10/25/2023 04:03] phoenixv110
How is Vault721.sol contract getting deployed? Is it getting deployed by another contract?


[10/25/2023 07:54] nmirchev8
Is SafeEngine responsible for tracking a debt/collateral ration of a user and initiate a liquidateion?


[10/25/2023 08:28] nethoxa
From what I remember, it is just a variable name, so it does not really matter which one you use. It was funny because `i++` is like an universal thing everyone uses since they start programming  and i showed it to friends and they were like

I'll be sure to share as soon as we know. Code4rena needs time to compile and throw out bogus ones so we will know in a few days is my guess, but not sure.
